Key Enhancements for Multiple Data Sources:

Source-Specific Missing Exposure Messages: The measuresMissingExposures field now includes the data source name, following the format shown in your email snapshot:

'IR Delta missing from [legacy] datasource'
'Vega missing from [cirt_rra] datasource'


Enhanced GNLR AMRS Testing (Scenario 5): Added specific scenarios to test when one data source has missing measures while the other has data, which should generate alerts like:

Legacy source missing IR Delta
CIRT source missing Vega


Complete Data Source Failure (Scenario 6): Added testing for when an entire data source is unavailable.

Implementation Changes:

Target File: Modified ratesdatasources.py instead of rateseodlimits.py
Function Location: Modifications go in the dataSourceFactory function
Source Tracking: Each simulation function now includes the sourceKey parameter to track which data source the missing measures should be attributed to

Key Testing Points:

Email Format Verification: Ensure missing exposure alerts follow the pattern: "[CFTC Error][Action Required] MissingExposures: VTD_NAME measures MEASURE_LIST missing from [SOURCE_NAME] datasource"
Multi-Source VTDs: Particularly important for GNLR AMRS which has both legacy and cirt_unified_screen sources
Granular Source Attribution: Each missing measure should specify exactly which data source it's missing from
